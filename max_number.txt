1)#recording the 1st element of the list as max number
#iterating over the loop using num variable comparing the variable everytime with the max number 
#and the greater number is recorded in max number finally the greater number of the loop gets printed

2)#same as above only the index function is used to iterate

3)#iterrating over the loop using while loop and using index as ind

4)Using built in max function

5)#using functools and lambda function logic used to get the greater number and get the greater value
